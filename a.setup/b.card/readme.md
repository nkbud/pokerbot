# Card Detection

## Prepare your game window
Snap your game window into a certain fixed size + aspect ratio.

> It can be in any position, but we are going to tune to this specific scale + ratio.

![example window snap](./_example_snap.png)

## Take a snip of the "10" card
> We choose the 10 card because we need to learn how to join the "1" and the "0". 

![example card snip](./_example_snip.png)

## Save the snip to this directory
> Save that file as `card.{ext}` where `{ext}` is an image extension like `.png`, `.jpg`, `.tiff`,>
etc.

## Execute the script:
> `py card.py`

You've just created a file called `card.props`.

Copy and paste that file into the next directory, `1_`(whatever it is now, i.e `1_learn`)

`../1_learn/config/card.props`
